Forgive me, Lord,
For I have fallen again!
Waking up in a sweat - my heart was beating wildly,
My throat was dry, in my chest,
That poison from which I had not been treated, was falling apart

Again this thirst, like a sharp blade
Pierces my spirit and calls me into the darkness...
I knew it was not worth it, but I took a sip
And again I am in the abyss, completely alone.
